I’m a web and mobile engineer who loves to work with `JavaScript`. I believe in building rich web and mobile client apps. I’m really excited about the emerging full stack JavaScript ecosystem with MV* frameworks and libraries like `Backbone.JS`, `AngularJS` and `D3.js`, server-side technologies like `Node.js` and `WebSockets` and HTML5 APIs like `WebRTC`.

I’m currently hacking on my own projects while studying Computer Science at [UC Berkeley](http://berkeley.edu). I’m also involved as an organizer of [Cal Hacks, the UC Berkeley Hackathon](http://calhacks.io),  and as a officer at [Startup@Berkeley](http://startup.berkeley.edu).

You can see some of my 1AM hacks on my [Github](http://github.com/dhruvarora).
